warHUD is a custom HUD modification for TF2, based on the legacy of RevanXP's HUD.
Its main design goal show things as bluntly yet mellow as possible. That is, things should be obvious and easy to look for, but never annoy your attention.

Install:

Click the "download ZIP" button on the right bar here on github.
Extract the warhud directory (NOT its contents!) to common/tf/custom/.
If you have an HUD crosshair already you should know what to do to move it over to this HUD.

Settings:

You can use 4plug to configure this HUD. There are font selections to choose from.

Custom crosshairs:

Not included. You'll have to add any HUD crosshairs you want yourself. There are many guides for doing so, so don't worry. It's very easy.

I missed RevanXP's HUD and get so frustrated when I play without it that I decided to make my own version of it from scratch.
I only have the most important elements right now. While this is a full release and completely playable, it is still buggy and doesn't change every last element.
Should be compatible with everything 5:4 and wider. Haven't tested MvM thoroughly on 5:4.
